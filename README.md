# MNIST Solutions

Within this repo there is a jupyter notebook along with two solutions using deep learning 
for the MNIST data set.

The first approach uses deep fully-connected networks and the second approach uses convolutional
networks.

This solution should get you in the top 10% on Kaggle for MNIST.

Also, please note that to run the python notebook you will need to pull in the test csv file from Kaggle's
